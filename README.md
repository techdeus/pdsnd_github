### Project Title
My Bike Sharing Data - authored by TechDeus

### Description
I am using Pandas and Numpy to analyze bike data across three major U.S. cities. The user can filter based on city, month and/or day to get the results they are looking for. Each section provides highlights of user data, riding data, location data and more.

### Files used
Bikeshare_2.py
Three CSV Files: New York, Chicago and Washington
